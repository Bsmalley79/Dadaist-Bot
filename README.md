# Dadaist-Bot
My first tweet bot
This project is to teach myself how to write in python.  This is a twitter bot that sometimes tweets out random letters based on their
frequency in American English.  More often it tweets based on a 5 letter Markov chain based on the last 140 tweets of several popular accounts.
