# Dadaist-Bot
My first tweet bot
This project is to teach myself how to write in python.  This is a twitter bot that tweets out random letters based on their
frequency in American English.  Yes I know Markov Chains are a thing.

Next on my to do list.  Reject triple letters, triple vowels, quadruple consonants.
